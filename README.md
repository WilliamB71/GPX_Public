# | Django | [GPX Converter](http://gpxconverter.pythonanywhere.com/): Direction Generator For Use With SmartWatches

in this project I developed a website that allows users to create GPX files, to be used with smartwatches and other GPS navigation devices easily and intuitively. By leveraging the Google Maps API up to date directions and the most time and energy efficent routes are produced.

The above video shows ease of use and importing to a smartwatch that takes under 40 from entering the website to navigation using a smartwatch.


# | Skills Developed |
In the Django project, Python served as the primary programming language, Leveraging the Django web framework, which is built with Python, I developed the website using its comprehensive set of tools and features like URL routing, database integration, and dynamic template rendering for error messages. HTML was utilised to define the website's structure and elements, including forms and layout, while CSS enhanced the visual presentation by defining styles, colours, and layouts for an appealing and user-friendly interface. The project's minimal database management relied on SQL.
